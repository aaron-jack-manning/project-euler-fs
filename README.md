# Project Euler F#

My ongoing project to document solutions to the first 100 problems of Project Euler in an efficient, idiomatic F# way using only language features and the standard library.

Note that many solutions I have put here are a work in progress, and will be improved over time to develop simpler code to do the same thing.

My ultimate goal is to have this repository be a tool to help programmers learn the great language of F#. It is however still a work in progress.
